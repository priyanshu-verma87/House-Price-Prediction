# üè† Housing Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning model built to predict housing prices based on various features using Python. It explores data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## About Dataset
This dataset provides comprehensive information for house price prediction, with 13 column names:

Price: The price of the house.

Area: The total area of the house in square feet.

Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
